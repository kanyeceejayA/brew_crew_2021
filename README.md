# brew_crew_2021

An update to the flutter & firebase tutorial Project by net Ninja (repo: https://github.com/iamshaunjp/flutter-firebase) from 2019.

It's accompanied by a video series linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfA3NWDBPZ4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC

Fully functional on Flutter 2.5 with the latest packages of everything.

## How To Run

- Follow the steps in Net Ninja's video to set up the Firebase Project, then import the google-services.json file into app.
- You won't have to copy any strings into gradle, but check those too if you run into any issues
- The App should run well
- Note: remove the first line in git-ignore if you would like to commit your google-services.json file to github
